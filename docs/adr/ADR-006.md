# ADR-006: Error Handling, Diagnostics, and Recovery

## Title
Error Handling, Diagnostics, and Recovery Strategies

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Robust error handling and diagnostics are essential for reliability and maintainability. ESP32-C6 supports logging, watchdog timers, and self-test routines.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Minimal Error Handling
- Basic error codes, no diagnostics
- Pros: Simple
- Cons: Hard to debug, poor reliability

### Alternative 2: Structured Error Handling and Diagnostics (Recommended)
- Use ESP-IDF logging (with levels)
- Implement self-test routines on boot
- Use watchdog timer for recovery
- Store error logs in NVS for post-mortem analysis
- Pros: Reliable, maintainable, easier debugging
- Cons: More code and documentation required

### Alternative 3: Remote Diagnostics
- Send error logs to cloud or app
- Pros: Easier remote support
- Cons: Requires network, privacy concerns

## Decision
Alternative 2: Structured error handling and diagnostics using ESP-IDF logging, self-test routines, watchdog timer, and persistent error logs.

## Consequences
- Improved reliability and maintainability
- Increased code and documentation effort
- Enables post-mortem analysis and recovery
