# ADR-011: Code Quality Tools and AI Usage Policy

## Title
Code Quality Tools and AI Usage Policy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Professional firmware development requires automated code quality tools and clear guidelines for AI-assisted development. This ensures maintainability, security, and traceability.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Manual Code Review Only
- Rely on human review for code quality
- Pros: Simple
- Cons: Misses automated checks, inconsistent style

### Alternative 2: Automated Code Quality Tools and AI Guidelines (Recommended)
- Use clang-format for code formatting
- Use cppcheck for linting
- Use pre-commit hooks for automation
- Use AI tools (e.g., Copilot) for boilerplate and documentation, with mandatory human review
- Attribute AI-generated code in comments or commit messages
- Pros: Consistent style, early error detection, efficient development
- Cons: Initial setup effort

### Alternative 3: Full CI/CD Integration
- Integrate all checks into CI server
- Pros: Best practice for large teams
- Cons: Not required for local-only workflow

## Decision
Alternative 2: Use clang-format, cppcheck, and pre-commit hooks for code quality. Use AI tools for development with mandatory review and attribution. Require documentation updates for each increment. Allow streamlined process for minor changes.

## Consequences
- High code quality and maintainability
- Efficient development with AI assistance
- Traceable and secure codebase
