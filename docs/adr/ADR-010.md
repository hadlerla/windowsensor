# ADR-010: Performance Optimization Strategies

## Title
Performance Optimization Strategies

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Efficient use of resources (CPU, RAM, flash) and low-latency response are critical for battery-powered, real-time sensor devices. ESP32-C6 offers hardware features and APIs for optimization.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Basic Optimization
- Rely on compiler optimizations and default settings
- Pros: Simple
- Cons: May miss critical bottlenecks

### Alternative 2: Targeted Performance Optimization (Recommended)
- Profile code for bottlenecks
- Optimize sensor polling, event handling, and network stack
- Use hardware features (DMA, interrupts, low-power modes)
- Minimize RAM/flash usage
- Pros: Maximizes battery life and responsiveness
- Cons: Requires profiling and tuning effort

### Alternative 3: Aggressive Optimization
- Hand-tuned assembly, custom memory allocators
- Pros: Maximum performance
- Cons: High complexity, hard to maintain

## Decision
Alternative 2: Use targeted performance optimization by profiling, tuning event handling, and leveraging ESP32 hardware features. Minimize resource usage and latency.

## Consequences
- High efficiency and battery life
- Requires profiling and ongoing tuning
- Maintainable and scalable codebase
