# ADR-009: Documentation and Code Standards

## Title
Documentation and Code Standards

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Consistent documentation and coding standards are essential for maintainability and collaboration. ESP-IDF projects benefit from clear code comments, API documentation, and markdown-based guides.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Minimal Documentation
- Only basic code comments
- Pros: Fast
- Cons: Hard to maintain, poor onboarding

### Alternative 2: Comprehensive Documentation and Coding Standards (Recommended)
- Use Doxygen-style comments for APIs
- Markdown documentation for architecture, setup, and usage
- Enforce naming conventions, code formatting, and review checklists
- Pros: Professional, maintainable, easy onboarding
- Cons: Requires discipline and review

### Alternative 3: External Documentation Tools
- Use tools like Sphinx or MkDocs
- Pros: Advanced features
- Cons: Overkill for firmware, more setup

## Decision
Alternative 2: Use Doxygen-style comments for APIs, markdown documentation for architecture and usage, and enforce coding standards via review checklists.

## Consequences
- High maintainability and onboarding speed
- Requires discipline and review
- Professional project image
