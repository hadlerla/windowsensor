# ADR-008: Testing and Quality Assurance

## Title
Testing and Quality Assurance Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Professional firmware requires thorough testing and quality assurance. ESP-IDF supports Unity for unit testing and provides integration with CI tools. Hardware-in-the-loop and integration testing are needed for sensor and protocol validation.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Manual Testing Only
- Test features manually on hardware
- Pros: Simple, no setup
- Cons: Error-prone, poor coverage, not scalable

### Alternative 2: Automated Unit and Integration Testing (Recommended)
- Use ESP-IDF Unity for unit tests
- Simulate sensor events and network conditions
- Hardware-in-the-loop for integration tests
- Pros: High coverage, repeatable, professional
- Cons: Initial setup effort, requires test hardware

### Alternative 3: Full CI/CD Integration
- Integrate with CI server for automated builds and tests
- Pros: Best practice, scalable
- Cons: Not required for local-only workflow

## Decision
Alternative 2: Use ESP-IDF Unity for automated unit and integration testing. Simulate sensor events and network conditions. Use hardware-in-the-loop for integration tests. Manual testing for field validation.

## Consequences
- High test coverage and reliability
- Initial setup effort required
- Professional and maintainable codebase
