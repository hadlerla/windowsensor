# US03: Secure Storage of WiFi Credentials

**As a** device owner
**I want** WiFi credentials to be stored securely and persistently
**So that** my network information is protected and survives reboots

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given WiFi credentials are entered via the web frontend,
  When they are saved,
  Then they are stored in encrypted NVS and used on next boot.
