# US08: Matter Stack Integration

**As a** developer
**I want** the Matter stack integrated into the firmware
**So that** the device can participate in a Matter fabric

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given the firmware is built,
  When the Matter stack is initialized,
  Then the device is ready for commissioning.
- Given the device is powered on,
  When it connects to WiFi (from M1),
  Then the Matter stack is operational.

## Dependencies
- US05 (Compile-Time Configuration of Pins/Defaults)
- M1 (WiFi Configuration Enablement)

## Technical Notes
- Use ESP-IDF Matter SDK or equivalent.
- Configure vendor, product, and device identifiers via Kconfig.
- Ensure secure credential storage for Matter fabric keys.
