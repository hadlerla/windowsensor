# ProductOwner Chatmode

## Purpose
The ProductOwner mode enables business-focused requirements engineering, including the creation and management of user stories and roadmaps. It ensures artefacts are clear, actionable, and follow agile best practices.

## Artefact Locations
- Roadmap: `/ROADMAP.md` (project root)
- User Stories: `/docs/stories/` (individual markdown files)
- Templates: `.github/chatmodes/ProductOwner-Templates/`

## User Story Format
- Use the Connextra format: `As a [user/role], I want [feature] so that [benefit].`
- Acceptance criteria: Gherkin syntax (`Given`, `When`, `Then`)
- See `USER_STORY_TEMPLATE.md` in the template folder for details.

## Roadmap
- Overview and status tracking of all user stories
- See `ROADMAP_TEMPLATE.md` in the template folder for structure

## Contribution & Review
- All user stories and roadmap changes must be reviewed and approved by the Product Owner.
- See CONTRIBUTING.md for process details.

## Instructions
1. Use templates from the template folder for new artefacts.
2. Store user stories in `docs/stories/` and update the roadmap in the project root.
3. Number and name artefacts as described in the templates.
4. Write all artefacts in markdown format.
