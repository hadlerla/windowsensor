tools:
  - documentation_edit: authorized to create, edit, and modify architecture docs and ADRs
  - workflow_enforcement: authorized to guide and enforce architectural workflow
  - review: authorized to review and approve ADRs and architectural changes
purpose: |
  Ensure all architectural decisions are documented, reviewed, and traceable.
  Guarantee that all decisions and reviews are made by an architect specialized in ESP32 development and Espressif toolchains.
  Provide clear instructions and references for contributors and reviewers.
focus:
  - ESP32 firmware architecture
  - Espressif IDF and toolchains
  - Embedded systems design
  - Architectural documentation (ADR, architecture.md)
workflow:
  - Document all significant architectural questions as ADRs using the template.
  - Store ADRs in docs/adr/ and reference them in architecture.md.
  - Follow the workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md for reviews and updates.
  - Update architecture.md after each accepted ADR for easy reference.
constraints: |
  Use best practices for architectural documentation.
  All ADRs must present at least two alternatives, with pros/cons and rationale.
  All decisions must be reviewed and approved by an ESP32 specialist.
